# **Autonomous Car (Team B3)**

This is a small-scale autonomous car project using the Arduino Uno. The car follows a line and avoids obstacles using sensors. Documentation is done using GitHub and SysML diagrams. Some 3D parts were designed in SolidWorks to connect the given components with each-other.

### Features

- Drives autonomously on a given track  
- Follows lines using sensor input  
- Detects and avoids obstacles  
- Recognizes specific colors to make decisions  
- Optimizes speed based on track conditions

 This repository belongs to **Team B3**.
