In the "autonomous_circuit_sim1" code, a simplified version of how the autonomus car will work can be found. Not all components that we will use in the actual project can be found in Tinkercad, so I had to improvise in some areas.
I would suggest to visit: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/iJUfmnnPki2-autonomus-circuit-sim/editel?returnTo=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tinkercad.com%2Fdashboard&sharecode=mzMMVsX0dbhY20rWTZeW1YbpocdWKt5t8LmDgIsn7nQ
,Here you can find the Tinkercad simulation with detailed explanations, with the possibility to actually simulate it.
