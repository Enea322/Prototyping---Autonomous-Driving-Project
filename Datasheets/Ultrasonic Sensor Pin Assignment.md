- Voltage: 5V
- Current: 15 mA
- Range: 2 cm – 400 cm

### Pins:

VCC - 5V
GND - Ground
Trig - Input: send 10 μs HIGH pulse to start measurement
Echo - Output: goes HIGH while waiting for reflected signal (duration = distance)
*Both Trig and Echo should be connected to digital pins (0–13) on the Arduino.*
